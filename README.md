Assuming you come from an RDBMS background, how do you model these structures in a NoSQL database? This repository covers possible impelmewntations (and limitations) with the following Databases

* [Aerospike](aerospike/README.md)
* [Redis](aerospike/README.md) (in progress)
* MongoDB (not started)
* MariaDB/MySQL (really, not need those as well????)
